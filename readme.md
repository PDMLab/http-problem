# Create problem+json documents  with Node.js

`problem-json` is a small library that allos you to create `problem+json` documents according to [RFC 7808](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807).

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev problem-json
```

## Usage

`problem-json` current supports these options:

* `type` (string) - A URI reference [[RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)] that identifies the problem type.
* `title` (string) - A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.
* `status` (number) - The HTTP status code ([[RFC7231], SectionÂ 6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6)) generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.
* Extension Members - Provide additional information.

### Example

To generate this `problem+json` result

```json
{
    "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
    "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
	"status": 400
}
```

this code is required:

```javascript
const httpProblem = require('problem-json');

const doc = new httpProblem.Document({
  type: 'https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit',
  title: 'You do not have enough credit.',
  status: 400
});
```

### Example with Extension Members

To generate this `problem+json` result

```json
{
    "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
    "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
    "balance": 30,
    "accounts": ["/account/12345", "/account/67890"]
}

```

this code is required:

```javascript
const httpProblem = require('problem-json');

const extension = new httpProblem.Extension({
  balance: 30,
  accounts: ['/account/12345', '/account/67890']
});

const doc = new httpProblem.Document({
  type: 'https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit',
  title: 'You do not have enough credit.'
}, extension);
```

## What's missing?

`problem-json` currently lacks support for `detail`-, `status`- and `instance`-Members. Also conventions for `type` are not implemented yet.

## Running the tests

```
npm test
```
